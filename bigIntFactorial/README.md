Calculate and print the factorial of a given integer.

Note: Factorials of n>20 can't be stored even in a 64-bit long long variable. Big integers must be used for such calculations. Languages like Java, Python, Ruby etc. can handle big integers, but we need to write additional code in C/C++ to handle huge values.

We recommend solving this challenge using BigIntegers.

Input Format

Input consists of a single integer "n"

Constraints
 0<n<100
